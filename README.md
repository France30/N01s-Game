# N01s-Game
This game is centered around a virus called N01 whose goal is to possess and destroy the user's computer
in every way possible. Though it is not clear why.

Knowing this, the player has to do all that they can to prevent him from winning by taking over.
But as the player was to launch the AntiVirus Program, N01 quickly corrupted the system enough to prevent the
player from erasing him completely. With this, the player is forced to battle the 'virus' as he slowly
corrupts more files of the computer.

<b>Disclaimer:</b> 
The source files aren't available as I'm currently in the processing of remaking the project from scratch. 

The original project was also left unfinished, thus some features seen in the game are unresponsive. Despite this, the project was the very first game I developed
that works from start to finish.

I also don't own the rights to the art.
